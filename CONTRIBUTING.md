# Contributing to Vibe

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Vibe! We welcome contributions
from everyone. By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our
[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Getting Started

### Fork and Clone

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/vibe.git
   cd vibe
   ```
3. Add the upstream repository as a remote:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/vibeapp/vibe.git
   ```

### Set Up the Development Environment

1. Install [Bun](https://bun.sh):
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
   ```
2. Install project dependencies:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```
3. Build all packages:
   ```bash
   bun run build
   ```

### Repository layout: two workspaces

Vibe is split across **two workspaces** in one repo:

- **`packages/*` — TypeScript framework.** A bun + Turborepo monorepo of `vibe/*`
  packages. This is the whole framework — Vibe apps are plain TypeScript. The steps
  above set it up.
- **`crates/*` — Rust bundler addon.** A small Cargo workspace with two crates:
  `vibe_bundler` (oxc-based static analysis of a Vibe app's agent/tool TypeScript
  modules) and `vibe_napi` (its napi binding). They power `vibe/build`'s agent→tool
  graph and code-splitting. The addon is an optional accelerator — `vibe/build` also
  has a pure-TypeScript path — so most contributors never touch Rust.

If you're only touching the framework, the bun setup is all you need. To work on the
bundler addon, set up the Rust toolchain below. See
[docs/contributing/00-contributing.md](docs/contributing/00-contributing.md)
for the full contributor workflow across both workspaces.

### Rust Toolchain (the bundler addon)

Only needed when working in `crates/*`:

1. Install [rustup](https://rustup.rs/). The repo pins its Rust version via
   `rust-toolchain.toml` (channel plus the `rustfmt` and `clippy` components), so
   rustup selects the right toolchain automatically inside the repo.
2. Build and test the Cargo workspace:
   ```bash
   cargo build
   cargo test
   ```
3. Format and lint before pushing (both gate CI):
   ```bash
   cargo fmt
   cargo clippy --all-targets -D warnings
   ```

A PR that touches `crates/` must have `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy` (no warnings), and
`cargo test` green — the Rust analog of the `bun run ci:check` gate.

## Development Workflow

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names with a conventional prefix:

- `feat/` — new features (e.g., `feat/add-system-monitoring`)
- `fix/` — bug fixes (e.g., `fix/resolve-memory-leak`)
- `chore/` — maintenance (e.g., `chore/update-dependencies`)
- `docs/` — documentation (e.g., `docs/add-api-guide`)
- `refactor/` — code refactoring (e.g., `refactor/extract-parser`)

### Conventional Commits

All commits must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
specification:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `perf`, `ci`, `style`.

Examples:
- `feat(core): add lifecycle hook system`
- `fix(logger): handle edge case in transport`
- `docs(api): document plugin interface`

### Pull Request Process

1. Create a feature branch from `main`.
2. Make your changes following the code style guidelines.
3. Write or update tests as needed.
4. Run the full test suite locally:
    ```bash
    bun test
    ```
5. Push your branch and open a pull request.
6. Ensure all CI checks pass.
7. Request review from maintainers.

## Code Style

We use [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for formatting and linting. Configuration
is in `biome.json` and `packages/biome-config/biome.json`.

```bash
# Format code
bun run lint --fix
```

Rules:
- Strict TypeScript mode (`strict: true`)
- No unused variables or parameters
- Path aliases defined in `tsconfig.json`
- Prefer named exports over default exports
- Use `type` imports for type-only imports

### General Guidelines

- Keep changes focused — one feature or fix per PR.
- Avoid adding unnecessary dependencies.
- Write clear, self-documenting code rather than adding comments.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility.

## Testing

All packages use [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/).

```bash
# Run all tests
bun test

# Run tests for a specific package
bun test --filter vibe/core

# Run tests in watch mode
cd packages/core && bun vitest --watch

# Run with coverage
bun test -- --coverage
```

### Test Structure

- Place tests in a `tests/` directory next to the source.
- Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior.
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern.

## Pull Request Requirements

### PR Title Format

PR titles must follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

### Labels

Every PR must have at least one of these labels:
- `semver:patch` — bug fixes and minor changes
- `semver:minor` — new features (backward compatible)
- `semver:major` — breaking changes

### Review Process

1. At least one maintainer review is required.
2. All CI checks must pass (lint, test, build, typecheck).
3. Changes may be requested by reviewers.
4. Once approved, a maintainer will merge the PR.

## Issue Reporting

### Bug Reports

Open a [bug report](https://github.com/vibeapp/vibe/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml)
with:
- A clear, descriptive title
- Steps to reproduce the behavior
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Environment details (OS, Vibe version, Node version)
- Minimal reproduction case, if possible

### Feature Requests

Open a [feature request](https://github.com/vibeapp/vibe/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml)
with:
- A clear, descriptive title
- Use case and motivation
- Proposed solution or API design
- Alternatives you've considered

### Security Issues

Do **not** open a public issue for security vulnerabilities. Please report
security issues privately to **security@vibe.dev**. See our
[Security Policy](SECURITY.md) for details.

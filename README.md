# Frontal Vibe

![Frontal Banner](./banner.jpg)

**Vibe is a TypeScript framework for building reliable enterprise agentic systems.**

Built by [Frontal](https://frontal.dev) and tailored for the Frontal ecosystem, Vibe provides a modular, type-safe foundation for developers who need to ship production-grade AI agents without reinventing the plumbing. It ships with batteries included — model providers, tool calling, memory, governance, and observability — while remaining flexible enough to let you swap any layer. Frontal is building an operating system for enterprise AI systems at scale, with data, ontology, and infrastructure at its core. Vibe is the agentic layer that ties it all together.

## Features

- **Agent-first architecture** — Define, compose, and orchestrate AI agents with a type-safe API
- **Model-agnostic** — Plug in any LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.) via a unified interface
- **Tool & function calling** — First-class support for tool use with structured input/output validation
- **Memory & state** — Persistent agent memory across sessions and conversations
- **Skills & workflows** — Composable building blocks for complex multi-step agent behaviors
- **Governance & safety** — Built-in policy engine, guardrails, and human-in-the-loop controls
- **Observability** — Tracing, logging, and metrics out of the box
- **Plugin system** — Extend Vibe with custom plugins and third-party integrations
- **Dependency injection** — Flexible DI container for wiring agent dependencies
- **Evaluation framework** — Benchmark and test agent performance systematically
- **Native performance** — optional Rust accelerators (via Node.js bindings) for the bundler,
  accurate context-window token counting, and OpenAI stream folding; every native path has a
  pure-TypeScript fallback, so the framework runs unchanged without them
